The code in this bundle was taken and adapted from https://github.com/codota/tabnine-intellij

Basically, instead of writing the downloader and manager for the TabNine binary myself, I have
adapted the one from the intellij plugin.

To make this clear (and to provide the possibility to refactor this common code into an IDE
independent common package) I have kept this code in its own bundle.
